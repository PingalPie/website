Hey, back bois previous diarys I was not able write because I didn't got the time. <br>
Today my father when came from office said that he brought something for me at first what I thought was a mini pc but then I remember that he would buy it in the end of the year and not this weak then I remembered that I asked my Father to buy me a book [Psycology of Money](https://www.amazon.com/Psychology-Money-Timeless-lessons-happiness/dp/0857197681/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1668615899&sr=8-1) and it was a book but when he was taking it out of his bag I saw that the book is a thick one then I knew that it is not Psychology of money and the next thought was about that it would be an tech book because he left a book on my table and that book is Complete reference MySQL 2009 actually the book he gave me turned out to be Unix Concepts and Applications 4th edition (2007) and I was surprised because the everlasting concepts explained in that book are really usefull and I wanted to study them.
