Hey, today was a kind of funny day in school most of the time I spent laughing with my friends, me and my homies were able to chill because most of the students had gone to make their projects for acadamic fair which is on the day after tommorrow and I made the project but in school they told that we have sumbit it on someday of previous month and I torn it into pisces and throwed it in dustbin because teachers were not taking it and it broke in my backpack so, it was waste keeping it for long.

Here is how now my next some days are going to be -
1. I'll read atleast 1 page of books - MySQL, Unix concepts and applications, the 48 laws of Power.
2. Solve atleast 10 problems of maths daily
3. Do homework (optional)
4. Learn web development
