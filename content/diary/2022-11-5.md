Hey, today I did was some fun and some learning in css and got to know about this fantastic book <a href="https://github.com/progit/progit2">progit</a> about git which I am going to read because git is a very important tool and it is more likely becoming like a concept. Let's meet tommorrow after starting reading.
Hey I'm back I didn't edited previous lines but these lines are new beacause of an idea which came in my mind this evening that we shoud have public libraries on internet so I made one on this website <a href="/library">here</a> it beacause of that idea I am adding some stuff in today's diary. Today in the afternoon my mother told me that we will go to a wedding of our relative in december in Shimla so that time I was thinking that before going there I should make a big project to impress someone if she gets my attention and that is not easyy, so let's hope that I will find someone I could talk about my problem, for my problems I could go to my parents because they are the root of the problem and I have tried to solved it many times but it is hard to solve but it is a gift to me by god has given me this gift so that I could solve it by myself then help others who are getting same issues.
