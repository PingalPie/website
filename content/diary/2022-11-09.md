Hey, today I setted up yt-local but didn't read progit. I have many plans now <br>
- Do machine learing & data science
	Because I want to take a step into ai.
- How machines work at kernel level
- CTFs I want to try a ctf (ctf --> capture the flag (a tournament for hackers))
- Play Badminton to get physically fit
- Create a YouTube channel, I want to overcome my social anxiety.
Tommorrow's plans
