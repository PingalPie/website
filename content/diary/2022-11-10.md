Hey, Today I wasn't able to do machine learing (ML). my school staff are full of bitches I have an exam tommorrow which is easy but there is one exam the day after tommorrow which is going to be really tough because syllabus isn't complete yet and our IT teacher gave us homework to write all the chapters ques/ans and there are 20 chapters and I didn't wrote any that's why I wasn't able to do anything productive I think my fingers are paining I just wrote 16 chapters and it's 10:30 already and my father is calling me to get to bed. I don't care about those fucking 20 chapters but the problem is I didn't do ML, I guarantee I'll do it tommorrow. What I did while doing my homework is watched 2 episodes of [Mr. Robot](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4158110/) Season 1, I have watched it till season 4 but didn't actually paid attention to dialogues I was watching it to just see hacking scenes but now I am watching it carefully.
