Hey, today I made some plans for tommorrow and I think that they will back fire may be. The day before yesterday my fav youtuber made a discord server for dank users its called dank linux users <a target="_blank" href="https://discord.gg/XJ4P2qVXau">here</a>, the day he made this server public (means make us know about it) he did a chat with us at night where we his subscribers and he talked I didn't talked because my mother was sitting in the same room as me and TV was having some cartoon on it but I wanted to talk becuase to overcome my social anxiety I am kinda shy to new people but if I know them in their outershell they become more scary to me because they told me what they wanted to and the Information I got filled by them could be manipulated, which means I could get targeted by them that is what I don't like getting targeted in front of audience and I don't like to talk to people in my school becuase I couldn't find anyone with same situations as me and if somebody has never know in what state I am in then they couldn't advise me as well. I want to overcome my social anxiety but I also wants to follow some rules which make me more introvert like I have a rule that states always say less than necessary you may ask why because when I was over talketive then I found out something that in flow of non-sense I reveal my secreat to whole world and becomes a big issue for me. After writing this diary I am going to add another book to my library <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=the+48+laws+of+power">the 48 laws of Power</a> which is a great book I have its paperback if I'll tell my rules then most of them will be from this book for sure.
