Hey today I found out that I should start fucking acadamics and make acadamics minimal and make skills an main priority to learn. Now I will stop my parents forcing me to do asshole things.
Lets, start our journey towards fucking society
Just keep clearing concepts and practice tools
For concepts
- read docs
- understand concepts in depth
- listen to talks
practicing tools require time
don't waste time (fuck social media)
