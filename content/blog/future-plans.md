I am one of those guys who aspires to do everything, like
I have extreme love for maths, physics, engineering, chemistry, (bit of) biology,
finance, quant, money, art, rapping.
the above list is actually in decrease order (most probably).

I really don't like society, because most of these cocksuckers look you through a lens, like I am supposed  to do one thing for life BUT I DONT GIVE A FUCK.

I want to live life my way, why the fuck should I go to a NIT (National Institute of Technology) when there exists a group of colleges, which have teachers who are ranked in top 5 in teaching, there are fucking IITs (Indian Institute of Technology)
Why should I settle for anything less than the best.


I will to not GIVE A FUCK TO SOCIETY, EVEN IF MY FAMILY ABANDONS ME.
So, here are the plans
+ Learn (pure) maths
+ Learn Physics
  like the mordern and classical
+ build algos for predicting behaviours in finance ( quant type shit )
+ Learn coding with to a great degree
  like 1. Galen Colin
       2. tsoding (Alexey Zozin)

Anyway plans for this week
1. Complete the chemistry notes for solutions chapter
2. Start reading chapters for english exam ( I'm in class 12 )
3. Do problem solving for maths exam
4. Start with Sir Walter Lewin's lecture series 8.03
   Waves are one of the weakest chapters in my physics preparation for JEE Advanced
5. Solve the problem written below
   "In a circular clock how many times do the hour and minute hand meet?"
   thoughts:
   - Could this be solved by modular arithmetic?
