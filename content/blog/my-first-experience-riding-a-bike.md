# Today I ride a bike first time in my lifetime
Today my sister was demanding to go to a park so my father decided to go and my mother said to me that I should go with them and she will convince my father that he will teach me how to ride a bike, We have two bikes currently one pulser and another we just bought hero passion. We bought hero passion bcz pulser was getting older it was about 10-12 year old, so it was degrading it self, that's why we decided to buy hero passion.
