# What I think about us
I think that we have 3 people in our body<br>
1. Soul
2. Brain
3. Mind (an asshole)

## First lets talk about Soul
It thinks spiritually, It seeks for the spirtual greatness. If I could relate it to linux world it's just like our boot (/boot) partition which help us load our feelings, memories, etc into real life. It has very less part of us but very important part it is. Without it we are just dead. It helps us grow spiritually and provide us strength to control ourselves. It has highest power if used safely and securely.

## Here comes the Brain part
It is a beautifull being, It consist of every basic thing but it does not know how to react in certain situations and it does not provide us feelings in linux world it's just like root (/) partition. It has bigger  than soul but it does not have the major part of our body. It helps us grow physically.

## Here comes the Mind part
It controls our feelings it lies in our scientific brain's special part <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothalamus" target="_blank">Hypothalamus</a>. When this part of our brain gets activated it just help us ruin our plans, it controls our feelings, It has complete power of our emotional being and if you could control it its great because you have controlled how to not let yourself ruin your plan. It helps us grow emotionally. In linux world it's just like home (/home) partition which has the major part of our body.
Here is a way to control it, there are a few steps mentioned below follow these they may help.

1. Meditate (to control mind you have to grow spiritually)
2. Speak less
