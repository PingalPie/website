# Where?
This site is hosted at https://pingalpie.vercel.app

# Why?
Because I wanted a place to share my thoughts.

You might ask, why not mastodon/X or any other?
I feel having an instagram account is already too much of social media for me.

# How?
This website is made with a static site generator [zola](https://www.getzola.org).
Some code is written by me, some are copied from youtubers [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed)

# Thanks
I, thank hyperplexed, CodeWithHarry, Myself who taught me how make stuff like this.
